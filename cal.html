        <p class="para-way">Kozhikode is situated in southern India between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, Kozhikode has been attracting travelers from antiquity. The city is also known by its Anglicized name, Calicut.

            Lured by the spice trade, Phoenicians, Arabs and Chinese headed for its shores. When Vasco da Gama landed on its shores in 1498, he paved the way for the Dutch, the French and later the English. As the major trading point of eastern spices, Calicut was known as the ‘City of Spices’.
            
            The city was founded in 1042 AD. The word Calicut is derived from Calico, hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from Kozhikode. Kozhikode was the capital of the Kingdom of Samoothiris or the Zamorin. The Samoothiri Kingdom became powerful among the kings of Kerala due to the flourishing international trade. The Samoothiri Rajas were the arch enemies of the Rajas of Valluvanad. Rather than being enraged by the loss of land and defeat in wars, the Valluvanad kings were incensed after their rights to hold the Mamankam festival, held every 12 years, was usurped by their enemy.
            
            To avenge the insult, Valluvanad Kings used to send an elite suicide squad called the Chaver Pada to assassinate the Samoothiri. In May 1498, Vasco da Gama arrived at the head of a naval fleet, opening a new chapter in history. The British extended their sway over Kozhikode and rest of Malabar after they defeated Tipu Sultan of Mysore.</p>

                <p style="color:white;">Kappad Beach has historically played an important role in the history of Kerala. On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170 men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala. The entire State, especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again.

                    A visit to Kozhikode is incomplete without a visit to this legendary site. The spice route flourished through this Beach. A walk in and around the place gives one an idea of itshistorical relevance. The rocks and small hills add to its charm. The nearby shacks are always stocked with excellent local delicacies and tea. Migratory birds can be spotted occasionally as well. Kappad Beach is a truly majestic destination, which will always hold an important place in our history.</p>

Well, then Janakikad is the destination where you can unwind yourself. Situated in the Maronthongara Panchayat, 7 km from Kuttiyadi, Janakikad comes under the Kuttiyadi range of Kozhikode forest division. Janakikad gets its name from the renowned statesman V. K.
