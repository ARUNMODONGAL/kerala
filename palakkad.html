                        <p style="color:white;">Parambikulam Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in the Chittur taluk of Palakkad district that lies cocooned in Nature's arms. Sprawling over an area of 285 sq. kms, the forest is home to some of the rarest of species found on our mysterious planet.

                            Though evergreen forests dominate the landscape, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, montane grasslands and shola forests also constitute the lush green vegetation. The mosaic terrain has helped a wide range of flora and fauna to flourish in this region.
                            
                            Featuring at the top of most trekkers' bucket list, this park is characterized by its two slopes and seven valleys. Vengolimala and Karimala Gopuram (tallest peak in the area), offer a glorious view of the valley, surrounded and serenaded by a multitude of endemic creatures.</p></div>

                            <h2 style="color:white;">3. SILENT VALLEY</h2>
                            <p style="color:white;">Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad district, Silent Valley was named a National Park only in 1984. It was called 'Sairandhrivanam' as it was here that Sairandhiri (the secret identity donned by Panchali, from the epic Mahabharata) is believed to have hidden along with her five husbands, the Pandavas, while escaping their cruel cousins, the Kauravas. The Kunthippuzha River which feeds the entire forest was named after Kunthi, mother of the Pandavas. It is shielded by the Nilgiri Plateau to the North and the Mannarkkad Plains to the South. It constitutes the centrepiece of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, an integral part of the Western Ghats, christened a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2012.

                                The flora and fauna found here makes one wonder if this ecosystem has survived since the very beginning of time. From tigers, leopards, elephants, snakes, Lion-Tailed Macaques and Malabar Giant Squirrels to moths, bugs and toads, the diversity in fauna is breath-taking. Along with them, one can view over 1,000 species of flowering plants and another 110 species of orchids that enchant all who see them. Over 400 species of moths and 200 species of butterflies have been catalogued here. The 128 species of beetles deserve a special mention since 10 of them were previously unknown to mankind.</p>
