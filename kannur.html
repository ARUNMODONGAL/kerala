        <p class="para-way">Located on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, Kannur (fondly known as Cannanore), is a beautiful city bundled with a plethora of sightseeing options like beaches, monuments, ancient temples and picnic spots.

            Steeped in the distinctive local art forms like Theyyam, Kannur still has an aura of the bygone colonial era. The deep footprints of the Dutch, the Portuguese, the British and the Mysore Sultanate are still imbibed into the town and can be witnessed all around. The town is blessed with exceptional art of weaving that has earned it the title of the land of loons and huge cashew trees perhaps rooted by Portuguese. Take an evening stroll near the lighthouse beach or explore Portuguese history at St. Angelo's Fort while you are in Kannur.</p>

            <h2 style="color:white;">1. PALAKKAYAM THATTU</h2>
            <p style="color:white;">Palakkayam Thattu is a picturesque hill station situated about 3500 ft above sea level. Many tourist-friendly activities have been organized in this secluded hill station, which was once a rather undiscovered gem. Adventure parks, viewing spots and tents have now been set up to engage visitors.

                The panoramic view of the meandering hills, the lush green valleys and the captivating beauty of the Western Ghats are the additional attractions. The pathway uphill is dotted with rubber and cocoa trees.
                
                Paithalmala, another tourist hotspot in Kannur, is located nearby, around 4 kms from Palakkayam Thattu.</p>

                <p style="color:white;">Built by the first Portuguese Viceroy in India, Don Francesco de Almeida (1505), St. Angelo’s Fort is among the most historic sites in Kannur. This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar.

                    Mopilla Bay and Dharamadam Island are among the primary attractions here. Mopilla Bay is a natural harbour and the fort offers a wonderful view of it along with a sea wall projecting from the fort separating the rough sea and inland water.  Dharamadam Island, barely 5 acres in area, is 100 m from the mainland and a favourite haunt of tourists. People come to the fort for relaxing strolls and just a brilliant view of the Arabian Sea.</p>

                    <p style="color:white;">Paithalmala is one of the most amazing tourist destinations in the district of Kannur. Nestled in the Western Ghats, the hill station looks over the Coorg valleys on one side and the plains of Kannur on the other. From the crest, if the fog lifts a little, you’d see tiny matchbox-sized houses in villages far down the valley.

                        The trail uphill is not arduous for a seasoned trekker. The sky is one magic palette. Every second, you find the formation change, as if you’re peering through a kaleidoscope, which turns on its own. A little ahead, the remains of an old fort catch the hint from the sky, glisten in gold. Suddenly you remember, how this fort fits in so snugly to the story you were regaled with, last evening. From the suicide point, look down to places far away flickering in the breeze.

                        <p style="color:white;">Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive-in beach. At about 7km from Thalassery in Kannur, you have a 4 km stretch of sand that awaits you to simply drive along as you soak in the view of the beautiful Malabar Coast. Along the way, one gets to munch on delicacies from a number of shacks that offer authentic Malabar cuisine. It is often considered a swimmers paradise as the black rocks protect the beach from deep currents. This is a perfect way to relax and soak in this clean and well maintained beach. One can also partake in adventure sports like paragliding, parasailing and micro light flights along with water sports, power boating or a simple catamaran ride
